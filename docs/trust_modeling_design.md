# Trust Modeling Design for Gaia Network Prototype

## 0. Context: The Challenge of Distributed Trust in Gaia Network

The Gaia Network aims to facilitate collaborative problem-solving and decision-making among distributed, autonomous nodes, each potentially holding different data, models, and objectives. A fundamental challenge in such a system is **evaluating the trustworthiness and reliability of information** exchanged between nodes.

Nodes in the Gaia Network may rely on:
*   **Internal computations:** Based on their own models and private data.
*   **Data from other nodes:** Received via queries, representing other nodes' beliefs or analyses.
*   **External data sources:** APIs, reports, sensor readings, human inputs, etc., potentially integrated by specific nodes.

The quality, accuracy, and potential biases of these information sources can vary significantly. Without a mechanism to assess reliability, nodes risk:
*   **Propagating errors:** Incorrect or low-quality data from one node can corrupt the beliefs and decisions of others.
*   **Being misled:** Biased or even malicious sources could manipulate network outcomes.
*   **Suboptimal decisions:** Failing to appropriately weight high-quality information or discount low-quality information leads to less accurate models and poorer decisions (e.g., miscalculating ROI due to unreliable climate risk data).

This trust modeling design addresses these challenges by introducing **"Grounding"**: a process where nodes collaboratively and probabilistically estimate the reliability ($\rho_{mj}$) of different sources (*j*) and modalities (*m*) as an integral part of their inference process. This allows the network to:

*   **Quantify Trust:** Move beyond binary trust/distrust to a nuanced, probabilistic understanding of source reliability.
*   **Learn from Experience:** Dynamically update reliability estimates based on observed data consistency and outcomes.
*   **Fuse Information Robustly:** Automatically weight information based on its estimated reliability during belief updates.
*   **Handle Diverse Scenarios:**
    *   **Integrating External Data:** Assess the reliability of external APIs or reports alongside internal node computations.
    *   **Privacy vs. Verification:** Provide mechanisms (like statistical verification) to establish confidence in claims made by nodes without requiring full transparency (which might violate privacy constraints).
    *   **Detecting Anomalies:** Systematically low reliability estimates for a source can signal potential issues (bias, malfunction, adversarial behavior).
    *   **Incentivizing Quality:** In future extensions, reliability scores could influence reputation or rewards, encouraging nodes to provide high-quality information.

By treating reliability itself as a variable to be inferred, the Gaia Network can become more robust, adaptive, and effective in leveraging distributed knowledge even amidst uncertainty and varying data quality.

## 0.1. Decision-Making Context and the Value of Information

Nodes within the Gaia Network are fundamentally **decision-making agents**. They often aim to identify or construct policies (sequences of actions or configurations) that optimize a local objective, such as maximizing expected financial return, minimizing climate risk impact, or achieving a target resilience level. In the language of Active Inference, they seek policies with low expected free energy.

To improve their decisions, nodes consume information from the network. However, acquiring and processing information incurs costs (e.g., query fees, computational resources, time delays). Therefore, a rational node should only seek information that offers a sufficient **Expected Value of Information (EVI)** relative to its cost. EVI quantifies how much an agent expects its decision quality to improve by obtaining a particular piece of information *before* actually receiving it.

The **reliability ($\rho_{mj}$)** of an information source *j* and modality *m* is a crucial factor in estimating the EVI of data assets ($\hat{x}_{vmj}$) originating from it. Information from a highly reliable source is more likely to significantly shift the node's beliefs about relevant latent variables ($x_v$) and thus lead to better decisions (higher EVI). Conversely, information from an unreliable source might be noisy or biased, offering little EVI and potentially even degrading decision quality.

By estimating and tracking source/modality reliability, nodes can:

*   **Prioritize Information Sources:** Preferentially query sources estimated to have high reliability (and thus potentially high EVI) for the needed information.
*   **Manage Costs:** Avoid spending resources on querying sources deemed unreliable.
*   **Calibrate Beliefs:** Appropriately discount information from less reliable sources during inference.

This creates an **implicit incentive structure**: sources that consistently provide high-quality, reliable information are more likely to be queried and have their information incorporated into the decisions of others, increasing their influence within the network. Conversely, unreliable sources risk being ignored. Therefore, estimating reliability is not just about passive risk management but also about actively navigating the network to find the most valuable information for effective decision-making.

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design for implementing trust modeling within the Gaia Network prototype. The goal is to allow nodes to collaboratively estimate the reliability of information sources and use these estimates to refine their own inferences, a process referred to as "grounding". This design is based on the concepts outlined in the "Grounding variables: The ActInf approach" document.

## 2. Core Concepts

*   **Source (j):** An entity (a Gaia Network node or an external identity) that provides data.
*   **Modality (m):** The process or method by which a source represents information (e.g., a specific sensor type, an analytical model, a manual report, a verified computation).
*   **Data Asset ($\hat{x}_{vmj}$):** The actual data provided by source *j* using modality *m* claiming to represent latent variable *v*. Can be observational/empirical (measurement) or analytical/downstream (meta-analysis). Includes data *and* metadata.
*   **Latent Variable ($x_v$):** The underlying "true" state or variable the network is trying to estimate (e.g., true flood probability, actual ROI).
*   **Representation Model:** A probabilistic model describing the relationship between the latent variable ($x_v$) and the data asset ($\hat{x}_{vmj}$), parameterized by reliability.
    *   **Measurement Model:** For observational data.
    *   **Meta-analysis Model:** For analytical data (forecasts, inferences).
*   **Reliability ($\rho_{mj} \in [0, 1]$):** A parameter representing the network's collective belief in the faithfulness of source *j*'s representation using modality *m*. $\rho=1$ indicates perfect representation (potentially still uncertain, but no *additional* noise/bias introduced by the source/modality), $\rho=0$ indicates the data provides no information about the latent variable.
*   **Precision:** The source's stated confidence or uncertainty in its own data asset (e.g., error bars, variance). Orthogonal to reliability.
*   **Grounding:** The process of simultaneously inferring latent variables ($x_v$) and estimating source/modality reliabilities ($\rho_{mj}$).

## 3. Implementation Strategy

We will integrate trust modeling into the existing Gaia Network framework by treating reliabilities ($\rho_{mj}$) as learnable parameters within the nodes' probabilistic models.

### 3.1. Data Structures

*   **Node State (`gaia_network/state.py::NodeState`):**
    *   Add a new attribute `reliabilities`: A dictionary storing the node's current belief about the reliability of various sources and modalities. The structure could be `{(source_id, modality_id): Distribution}`, where `Distribution` represents the posterior belief about $\rho_{mj}$ (e.g., a Beta distribution, as $\rho \in [0, 1]$).
    *   Need a way to define/register modalities. Initially, we can use simple string identifiers (e.g., "direct_query", "actuarial_report_v1", "statistically_verified_computation").

*   **Query/Response (`gaia_network/query.py`):**
    *   Ensure `Response` metadata *always* includes `source_id`.
    *   Add an optional `modality_id` to the metadata. If not present, a default can be assumed (e.g., "direct_query").
    *   Optionally, allow responses to include source-provided `precision` information (e.g., variance).
    *   Add optional `verification_method: str` and `verification_details: dict` to metadata, indicating how a claim was verified (e.g., 'reproduced', 'statistically_verified', 'none') and providing relevant details (e.g., number of workers, confidence level).

### 3.2. Representation Models

Nodes need models to describe the probabilistic relationship between a latent variable ($x_v$) and the data asset provided by a source ($\hat{x}_{vmj}$), incorporating the estimated reliability ($\rho_{mj}$). These models define the likelihood term $P(\hat{x}_{vmj} | x_v, \rho_{mj})$ used in the inference process.

*   **Location:** A new module, perhaps `gaia_network/representation_models.py`.

*   **Model for Continuous Variables (e.g., Gaussian):**
    *   **Assumption:** The latent variable $x_v$ is continuous (e.g., representing a financial value or a physical measurement). We might have a prior belief $x_v \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_x, \sigma_x^2)$.
    *   **Observation Model:** The data asset $\hat{x}_{mj}$ is modeled as a noisy observation of the latent variable:
        $\hat{x}_{mj} = x_v + \epsilon_{mj}$
        where $\epsilon_{mj} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{obs}^2)$ is the observation noise introduced by the source *j* using modality *m*.
    *   **Linking Reliability:** The reliability $\rho_{mj} \in [0, 1]$ parameterizes the observation noise variance $\sigma_{obs}^2$. A higher reliability implies lower noise. A simple model could be:
        $\sigma_{obs}^2 = \sigma_{min}^2 + (\sigma_{max}^2 - \sigma_{min}^2)(1-\rho_{mj})$
        Here, $\sigma_{min}^2$ represents the minimal noise achievable (inherent precision limit of the modality, potentially even 0 for perfect sources), and $\sigma_{max}^2$ represents the noise variance when the source provides no information ($\rho_{mj}=0$). This could be set relative to the prior variance $\sigma_x^2$ or based on domain knowledge.
    *   **Likelihood:** This defines the likelihood $P(\hat{x}_{mj} | x_v, \rho_{mj}) = \mathcal{N}(\hat{x}_{mj}; x_v, \sigma_{obs}^2(\rho_{mj}))$.

*   **Model for Categorical Variables:**
    *   **Assumption:** The latent variable $x_v$ is categorical, taking one of $K$ states, with prior $P(x_v=k) = \pi_k$. The data asset $\hat{x}_{mj}$ is also a category from the same $K$ states.
    *   **Observation Model:** We use a **confusion matrix** $C(\rho_{mj})$ where the entry $C_{ik} = P(\hat{x}_{mj}=i | x_v=k, \rho_{mj})$ gives the probability of observing state $i$ when the true state is $k$, given the reliability $\rho_{mj}$.
    *   **Linking Reliability:** Reliability $\rho_{mj}$ controls how "diagonal" the confusion matrix is. A simple model assumes reliability corresponds to the probability of reporting the *correct* category, with errors distributed uniformly among incorrect categories:
        *   $P(\hat{x}_{mj}=k | x_v=k, \rho_{mj}) = \rho_{mj} + \frac{1-\rho_{mj}}{K}$  (Probability of correct observation)
        *   $P(\hat{x}_{mj}=i | x_v=k, \rho_{mj}) = \frac{1-\rho_{mj}}{K}$ for $i \neq k$ (Probability of specific incorrect observation)
    *   **Interpretation:**
        *   If $\rho_{mj} = 1$, then $P(\hat{x}_{mj}=k | x_v=k) = 1$ (perfect accuracy).
        *   If $\rho_{mj} = 0$, then $P(\hat{x}_{mj}=i | x_v=k) = 1/K$ for all $i, k$ (observation is pure noise, independent of $x_v$).
    *   **Likelihood:** This defines the likelihood $P(\hat{x}_{mj} | x_v, \rho_{mj})$ based on the confusion matrix structure. More complex models could allow for asymmetric confusion probabilities.

*   **Integration:** Nodes will select the appropriate representation model based on the type of variable being queried (defined in the `Schema`). When incorporating incoming data (`QueryResponse` objects), nodes will use these models in their inference update (Section 3.3). Metadata in the response (like `verification_method`) could potentially influence the *prior* belief assigned to $\rho_{mj}$ before performing the Bayesian update.

### 3.3. Inference Process (`gaia_network/node.py::Node`)

*   **Combined Inference:** The core change is that the node's inference process (when updating its `state` based on received data) must *simultaneously* update its beliefs about:
    1.  The latent variables relevant to the data ($x_v$).
    2.  The reliability of the data source/modality ($\rho_{mj}$).
*   **Mechanism:** When a node receives a `Response` ($\hat{x}_{vmj}$):
    1.  Retrieve the current belief about the latent variable $P(x_v)$ and reliability $P(\rho_{mj})$ from `node.state` (potentially using metadata like `verification_method` to inform the prior for $\rho_{mj}$).
    2.  Use the appropriate representation model to define the likelihood $P(\hat{x}_{vmj} | x_v, \rho_{mj})$.
    3.  Perform a Bayesian update to compute the joint posterior $P(x_v, \rho_{mj} | \hat{x}_{vmj}) \propto P(\hat{x}_{vmj} | x_v, \rho_{mj}) P(x_v) P(\rho_{mj})$.
    4.  Update `node.state` with the new marginal posteriors for $P(x_v | \hat{x}_{vmj})$ and $P(\rho_{mj} | \hat{x}_{vmj})$.
*   **Probabilistic Framework:** This requires the underlying probabilistic framework used by the nodes to handle parameter learning (estimating $\rho_{mj}$) alongside state estimation ($x_v$). If using a framework like PyMC or Pyro, this is standard. If the current implementation uses simpler distribution updates, this might require significant refactoring or approximation methods (e.g., assuming point estimates for $\rho_{mj}$ during the $x_v$ update, then updating $\rho_{mj}$ based on the result). *Initial implementation might need to approximate this joint update.*

### 3.4. Establishing High Trust: Verifiability Mechanisms

#### 3.4.1. Direct Reproducibility
*   **Mechanism:** If Node *i* receives a response from Node *j* and *i* can fully verify *j*'s computation by reproducing it (e.g., *j* provides its exact model code/version, all necessary inputs including source data or commitments, and the response is demonstrably the result of running that code on those inputs), *i* can directly assign a high, fixed reliability.
*   **Outcome:** Assign $\rho_{mj}$ a distribution representing near certainty at 1.0 (e.g., `Beta(alpha=large_number, beta=1)`) for that specific interaction or source/modality pair. This bypasses the standard Bayesian reliability update for this instance.

#### 3.4.2. Statistical Verification for Private Data / Complex Computations
When direct reproduction is infeasible (e.g., due to data privacy or computational complexity), nodes can engage in **statistical verification protocols** to establish high confidence in a specific claim made by a Prover node. Inspired by techniques for verifying complex computations like Variational Inference on private data:
*   **Mechanism:** The Prover makes a claim (e.g., optimal parameters $\lambda^*$, a forecast distribution). Other nodes act as auditors/workers. The Prover distributes verification tasks (e.g., checking gradient components on data subsets, checking consistency properties) across many workers. Workers perform checks (potentially using privacy-preserving techniques like **Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)** if raw data subsets cannot be shared) and report results. Consensus among workers provides statistical evidence supporting the Prover's claim.
*   **Outcome:** Successful statistical verification does not yield deterministic proof but provides strong evidence, justifying assigning a high-confidence prior or posterior belief for $\rho_{mj}$ related to that specific claim (e.g., a Beta distribution tightly concentrated near 1). The level of confidence depends on the protocol parameters (number of workers, redundancy, consensus threshold), which should be reflected in the assigned reliability distribution.
*   **Implementation:** Requires defining specific protocols, worker coordination mechanisms, and potentially integrating cryptographic libraries for MPC. This represents a significant increase in complexity compared to simple reproducibility checks but enables trust in opaque computations based on statistical guarantees.

### 3.5. Sharing Reliability Parameters (Federated Learning)

*   **Mechanism:** Nodes can query each other not just for data about external variables, but also for their *beliefs about reliabilities*. This allows the network to pool experience and learn trust faster.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Define new query types, e.g., `QueryType.GET_RELIABILITY_BELIEF`.
    *   Nodes respond with their current distribution for the requested $\rho_{mj}$.
    *   Receiving nodes can pool this information (e.g., averaging parameters of Beta distributions, Bayesian model averaging, or more sophisticated pooling methods) to update their own reliability beliefs. This amortizes the cost of learning reliabilities across the network.

### 3.6. Applying Reliability (Beyond just learning it)

*   Learned reliabilities should influence future interactions:
    *   **Query Prioritization:** Nodes might prioritize querying sources with higher estimated reliability or sources whose reliability they want to learn more about (exploration vs. exploitation).
    *   **Data Fusion:** When combining information from multiple sources about the same variable, the reliability estimates are used to weight the contribution of each source. The representation model inherently does this if implemented correctly within the Bayesian update.
    *   **Downstream Decision Making:** The uncertainty in reliability itself ($P(\rho_{mj})$) should propagate through calculations (e.g., ROI calculations should be sensitive to the reliability of the climate risk data). This means downstream models need to accept distributions (or samples) for inputs, not just point estimates.

## 4. Prototype Integration (`demo/`)

*   **Initialization:** Nodes start with prior distributions for reliabilities (e.g., `Beta(1, 1)` - uniform/uninformative, unless metadata suggests otherwise, e.g., based on `verification_method`).
*   **Interactions:** Modify `run_demo.py` and `run_web_demo.py`:
    *   When Node A queries Node B for flood risk, Node A updates both its belief about flood risk *and* its belief about $\rho_{B, 'flood_risk_model'}$ based on the received data and the representation model.
    *   When Node B queries Node C for actuarial data, Node B updates its beliefs about the data *and* $\rho_{C, 'actuarial_data'}$.
    *   When Node A queries Node D for bond info, it updates beliefs about bond parameters *and* $\rho_{D, 'bond_model'}$.
*   **Logging:** Add logging to show the evolution of reliability distributions (e.g., mean and variance of $P(\rho_{mj})$) for key interactions.
*   **Scenarios:**
    1.  **Baseline:** Run the demo, observe gradual learning of reliabilities from default priors.
    2.  **Noisy Node:** Introduce noise into Node C's responses. Show that Node B's estimate of $\rho_{C, 'actuarial_data'}$ decreases (mean goes down, variance might change). Show how this lower reliability propagates uncertainty, potentially affecting Node A's final calculations (e.g., wider ROI distribution).
    3.  **Federated Learning:** Add steps where nodes explicitly query each other for reliability beliefs and pool them. Show faster convergence or stronger confidence in reliability estimates compared to baseline.
    4.  **Verifiability:** Simulate Node D providing a result with metadata indicating it was 'reproduced' or 'statistically_verified'. Show Node A assigns a much higher initial/updated reliability score compared to an unverified claim.

## 5. Open Questions & Challenges

*   **Scalability:** Managing potentially numerous reliability parameters for many sources and modalities. Hierarchical models for reliability might be needed.
*   **Modality Definition:** Establishing a clear, shared taxonomy of modalities and verification methods. How specific should modalities be?
*   **Representation Model Complexity:** Moving beyond the simple white noise model to capture biases, correlations between sources, context-dependent reliability, etc.
*   **Inference Complexity:** Ensuring the joint inference of $x_v$ and $\rho_{mj}$ is computationally tractable within the prototype's framework. Approximations (like variational inference for reliability parameters) might be needed.
*   **User Interpretation:** How to present reliability information and its uncertainty to end-users (e.g., in the web demo) in an understandable way.
*   **Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms:** Implementing trust estimation and verification securely when nodes handle sensitive data poses a major challenge. Techniques like Federated Learning for sharing reliability beliefs or MPC for statistical verification introduce significant computational and communication overhead and implementation complexity.
*   **Verification Protocol Design:** Designing robust and efficient statistical verification protocols suitable for the types of claims made within the Gaia Network requires careful consideration of security assumptions (e.g., worker collusion models), privacy trade-offs, and computational feasibility.

### 5.1. Inference Complexity: Variational Inference for Reliability

The challenge noted under "Inference Complexity" regarding the joint inference of latent variables ($x_v$) and reliability parameters ($\rho_{mj}$) warrants further detail, particularly concerning the use of Variational Inference (VI).

*   **The Intractability Problem:** The Bayesian update requires computing the joint posterior $P(x_v, \rho_{mj} | \hat{x}_{vmj}) \propto P(\hat{x}_{vmj} | x_v, \rho_{mj}) P(x_v) P(\rho_{mj})$. The likelihood term $P(\hat{x}_{vmj} | x_v, \rho_{mj})$ derived from the representation models (Section 3.2) often leads to a posterior that lacks a closed-form solution or is computationally expensive to sample from (e.g., using MCMC).

*   **VI Approach:** VI approximates the true posterior $P(x_v, \rho_{mj} | \dots)$ with a simpler distribution $Q(x_v, \rho_{mj})$ chosen from a tractable family (the variational family). A common choice is the mean-field approximation, which assumes factorization: $Q(x_v, \rho_{mj}) = Q_v(x_v) Q_{\rho}(\rho_{mj})$. The goal is to find the parameters of $Q_v$ and $Q_{\rho}$ that minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence $KL(Q || P)$. This optimization typically leads to iterative update equations for $Q_v$ and $Q_{\rho}$.

*   **Challenges Specific to $Q_{\rho}(\rho_{mj})$:**
    *   **Parameter Space:** Since $\rho_{mj} \in [0, 1]$, the variational distribution $Q_{\rho}(\rho_{mj})$ should respect this constraint. The Beta distribution is a natural choice, $Q_{\rho}(\rho_{mj}) = \text{Beta}(\alpha_{mj}, \beta_{mj})$, where $\alpha_{mj}$ and $\beta_{mj}$ are the variational parameters to be optimized.
    *   **Non-Conjugacy:** The representation models (e.g., Gaussian likelihood where $\rho_{mj}$ controls the variance, or the categorical likelihood) generally do not result in a likelihood term that is conjugate to a Beta prior/variational distribution for $\rho_{mj}$, especially when considering the expectation over $Q_v(x_v)$. This means the standard VI updates may not have closed-form solutions, requiring numerical optimization within each VI step or more advanced VI techniques (e.g., using specific bounds, non-conjugate VI methods).
    *   **Coupled Updates:** The optimal $Q_{\rho}(\rho_{mj})$ depends on the current $Q_v(x_v)$, and vice-versa. These dependencies must be handled within the iterative updates, ensuring convergence.
    *   **Scalability:** Applying potentially complex VI updates across a large number of reliability parameters (one for each source-modality pair relevant to a node) requires efficient implementation and potentially approximations. Hierarchical priors on $\rho_{mj}$ could help but add further complexity.
    *   **Initialization and Local Optima:** VI optimization can converge to local optima. Initializing the variational parameters ($\alpha_{mj}, \beta_{mj}$) appropriately might be crucial.

*   **Alternatives & Trade-offs:** While VI offers a scalable approximation method, alternatives include:
    *   **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC):** Asymptotically exact but computationally expensive, likely too slow for real-time network interactions.
    *   **Laplace Approximation:** Approximates the posterior locally with a Gaussian, which might be unsuitable for the constrained Beta-like posterior of $\rho_{mj}$.
    *   **Point Estimates (Phase 1 approach):** Simplest approach, tracking only a single value (e.g., the mean) for $\rho_{mj}$, ignoring uncertainty. Less accurate but highly efficient.
    *   **Decoupled Updates (Approximation):** Assume $\rho_{mj}$ changes slowly and update it less frequently or based on aggregate statistics, simplifying the $x_v$ update.

Choosing the right inference strategy involves balancing accuracy, computational cost, and implementation complexity, especially within the constraints of a distributed network prototype. Initial phases might rely on simpler methods, with VI being a candidate for more advanced, accurate reliability tracking.

## 6. Next Steps (Implementation Phases)

    *   Implement the basic Gaussian white noise representation model logic conceptually.
    *   Modify `Node`'s response handling to *store* reliability estimates.
    *   Implement a *simplified* update rule for reliability point estimates based on prediction error (e.g., if observed data $\hat{x}$ is far from node's prior expectation $E[x_v]$, decrease reliability score towards 0; if close, increase towards 1).

    *   Explore more complex representation models.
